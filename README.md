# COMP3351 – 3D Modeling & Animation using Blender 🎨🧊

This repository showcases a series of 3D modeling and animation activities completed during the COMP3351 course at Birzeit University (2023). The work includes various Blender techniques, assignments, and research.

## 📁 Topics Covered:
Each folder represents a different modeling or animation concept, including:

- **Array Modifier – with Curve**: Repeating objects along a curved path.
- **Boolean Operations**: Combining and subtracting mesh objects.
- **Screw Technique**: Creating spiral-based 3D shapes (e.g. bolts, cups).
- **Spin Activity**: Generating radial symmetrical objects (like goblets).
- **UV Editing**: Unwrapping 3D models for texture mapping.
- **Sculpting**: Organic model shaping.
- **Follow Path (طِیَارة)**: Object animation along a path.
- **Curve Logo**: Designing and animating logo with curves.
- **Lighting & Mist**: Adding atmosphere and realism to scenes.
- **Mirror Modifier**: Symmetrical modeling.
- **Final Model (Cup)**: Complete Blender scene using multiple modifiers.

## 📄 Assignments:
- **Assignment1_1191003**: Basics of modeling and modifiers.
- ass2_report**: Comparison of Blender, Maya, and 3ds Max tools based on:
  - Usability in the industry  
  - Rendering performance  
  - Job market demand  
  - Learning documentation



## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Blender 3.x
- Google Docs (for written report)
